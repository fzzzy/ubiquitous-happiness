Practice project for grokking redux more deeply

To run, `npm start` and visit `http://localhost:7777/webpack-dev-server/increment` or `http://localhost:7777/webpack-dev-server/hello`

To generate static html files, first you need to have installed http-server globally with `npm install -g http-server`, and then you can run `npm run build && http-server dist -p 9999` and visit `http://localhost:9999/increment.html` or `http://localhost:9999/hello.html`
